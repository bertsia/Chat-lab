# Chatbot Experimentation Project

## Purpose
I intend to use this project as a learning experience. I wanna experiment with ways to use tools and agents to make interactions with chatbots more engaging.

## User interface
I created a very basic server through the flask library for the sake of interacting with the chatbots through an even more basic webb page.

## Contribution
Feel free to fork the project and build upon it if you like :)
I currently use Ollama and GROQ API to connect with the chatbots. If this is new to you, here are links to their websites.

Ollama:
Helps you set up a local server download and chat with large language models.

GROQ
Offer an API service that allow you to use their super fast "LPU INFERENCE ENGINE". Convenient if you have a slow old computer, like me.
